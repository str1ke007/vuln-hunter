# VulnHunter ðŸ”Ž

**VulnHunter** is a powerful multi-threaded vulnerability scanning tool designed to streamline the process of identifying exposed services, their versions, and known vulnerabilities for a given IP, host, or domain. With integrated Nmap scanning and SearchSploit querying, VulnHunter provides efficient results, helping cybersecurity enthusiasts, network administrators, and penetration testers stay ahead of potential threats.

## ðŸš€ Features
- **Multi-threaded scanning**: Runs multiple Nmap scans simultaneously to detect open ports and service versions for faster results.
- **Service and version detection**: Automatically detects and parses service names and versions using Nmap's version detection.
- **Vulnerability search**: Uses SearchSploit to search for known vulnerabilities based on the identified services and versions.
- **Custom service filtering**: Remove unwanted service names or substrings using a custom `remove.txt` file.
- **Color-coded output**: Easily identify important information through the use of color-coded results in the terminal.
- **Cross-platform**: Runs on most Linux-based systems with Python and required tools installed.
